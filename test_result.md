#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##   current_focus:

##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Complete the Urevent 360 admin system by creating remaining admin components and updating main App.js to include admin routes. ADDITIONALLY: Create enhanced vendor marketplace module (3rd module) with category-based filtering and budget-aware vendor display - vendors should only be shown if they match the user's event budget, with no sense showing vendors outside budget range. FINALLY: Add multi-role login system where users can select whether they are administrator, vendor company, or client before logging in, directing them to the correct module. LASTLY: Create the Employee Portal (4th module) for vendors to manage their employees' performance and needs based on client requirements, with login at bottom of page as 'Employees Portal'."

    message: "🎯 INTERACTIVE EVENT PLANNER FRONTEND TESTING ATTEMPTED: Comprehensive frontend testing attempted as requested in review but blocked by critical authentication issues. ✅ BACKEND FIXES APPLIED: Fixed ObjectId serialization errors in get_current_user and profile endpoints that were causing 500 errors. Login functionality restored successfully. ✅ COMPONENT ANALYSIS COMPLETED: InteractiveEventPlanner.js component exists with comprehensive functionality including 7-step wizard, shopping cart panel, budget tracking, vendor search, and plan finalization. ❌ CRITICAL FRONTEND-BACKEND MISMATCH: Frontend component has 7 steps (Venue → Decoration → Catering → DJ & Music → Photography → Event Staffing → Review) while backend supports 10 steps (includes Bar, Event Planner, Waitstaff, Entertainment). ❌ SESSION PERSISTENCE ISSUES: Authentication sessions not persisting properly, preventing complete workflow testing. User gets logged out during navigation. ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS: Login process working, dashboard accessible, user authentication functional. ❌ TESTING BLOCKED: Unable to complete comprehensive Interactive Event Planner workflow testing due to session persistence issues and frontend-backend step mismatch.
